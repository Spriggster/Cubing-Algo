### Cubing-Algo
_For the Algorithm project_

I'll be honest, I'm not very good at solving cubes. I've never owned a rubix cube or the likes of a rubix cube. The only cube I've learned about ever is the Pyramix duo when the presentations were done last year. I hope to improve and learn the sckuwb or the pyramix.
